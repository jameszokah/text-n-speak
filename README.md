How Text-to-Speech Works
TTS works with nearly every personal digital device, including computers, smartphones and tablets. All kinds of text files can be read aloud, including Word and Pages documents. Even online web pages can be read aloud.

The voice in TTS is computer-generated, and reading speed can usually be sped up or slowed down. Voice quality varies, but some voices sound human. There are even computer-generated voices that sound like children speaking.

Many TTS tools highlight words as they are read aloud. This allows kids to see text and hear it at the same time.

Some TTS tools also have a technology called optical character recognition (OCR). OCR allows TTS tools to read text aloud from images. For example, your child could take a photo of a street sign and have the words on the sign turned into audio.

How Text-to-Speech Can Help Your Child
Print materials in the classroom—like books and handouts—can create obstacles for kids with reading issues. That’s because some kids struggle with  and understanding printed words on the page. Using digital text with TTS helps remove these barriers.

And since TTS lets kids both see and hear text when reading, it creates a multisensory reading experience. Researchers have found that the combination of seeing and hearing text when reading:

Improves word recognition

Increases the ability to pay attention and remember information while reading

Allows kids to focus on comprehension instead of sounding out words

Increases kids’ staying power for reading assignments

Helps kids recognize and fix errors in their own writing

Like audiobooks, TTS won’t slow down the development of your child’s reading skills.
